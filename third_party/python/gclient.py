"""A wrapper script to manage a set of client modules in different SCM.

This script is intended to be used to help basic management of client
program sources residing in one or more Subversion modules, along with
other modules it depends on, also in Subversion, but possibly on
multiple respositories, making a wrapper system apparently necessary.

Files
  .gclient      : Current client configuration, written by 'config' command.
                  Format is a Python script defining 'solutions', a list whose
                  entries each are maps binding the strings "name" and "url"
                  to strings specifying the name and location of the client
                  module, as well as "custom_deps" to a map similar to the DEPS
                  file below.
  .gclient_entries : A cache constructed by 'update' command.  Format is a
                  Python script defining 'entries', a list of the names
                  of all modules in the client
  <module>/DEPS : Python script defining var 'deps' as a map from each requisite
                  submodule name to a URL where it can be found (via one SCM)
