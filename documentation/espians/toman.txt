Preamble
--------

The right of humanity to survive in this Universe is neither inalienable nor
guaranteed. It is by our actions


----------
Principles
----------

1. Melanin is a social enterprise committed to enabling and nurturing "true
   communities" around sustainable social, economic and environmental values.

2. Melanin is designed as a robust, network-based organisation that has at its
   core, a team and infrastructure that provides leadership, innovation and
   support services for this purpose.

1. Melanin is an "enabling organisation" that is built on shared principles of
   practise which all Espians subscribe to.

   1. *Rule of Ethics.*

   1. *Social Business.* Combining elements of a commercial enterprise with
      elements of a not-for-profit organisation, Melanin will not distribute
      profits to shareholders -- it has no shareholders -- and instead shares
      the financial and other values it produces equitably amongst Espians to
      further their social objectives.

   2. *Dignity.* By enabling people to have the freedom to access opportunities,
      contribute and be heard, Melanin seeks to raise the inherent value in
      local communities in a way that respects human dignity and potential. It's
      not just what you do but how you do it. A deep ecology approach.

   3. *Integrity.* The health of all communities, including Melanin's, is
      dependent on the inner and outer awareness and well-being of its members.
      An integral, holistic approach needs to be taken -- healing past damages
      appropriately -- in the process of becoming whole.

   4. *Peer-to-Peer.* Social technologies and processes can enable communities
      to self-organise and tack complex, real-world situations in pragmatic ways
      that is mutually beneficial for all involved -- so that higher values of
      social and economic justice can prevail.

   5. *United Diversity.* Melanin's decentralised and flexible structure is
      powered from the periphery and unified from the core -- fostering
      diversity, complexity and change in a way that counters the paradigm of
      command and control.

   6. *Self-Rule & Democracy.* Power, rights, responsibility and rewards are
      distributed equitably amongst Espians whilst ensuring that the cultures
      and conditions for learning, risk-taking and inter-disciplinary innovation
      are cultivated in ever expanding circles.

   7. *Transparency.* By being open and transparent, Melanin will act as an
      ethical bridge to help rebuild trust within communities -- trust often
      lost due to a lack of accountability by those in positions of
      responsibility regarding the commitments they have made towards achieving
      social equity.

   8. *Emergence.* The most meaningful connections and some of the most powerful
      outcomes happen without being planned. Melanin cultivates a dynamic mix
      of old and new worldviews, of top down and bottom up, of chaos and order
      and of leadership and participation -- such that higher forms of value and
      life unfold.

   9. *Cooperative Values.* Melanin recognises that "together, we have
      everything" and subscribes to the 1995 Statement of Cooperative Identity
      of the International Cooperative Alliance.

   3. The shared goals  work is carried out through policies approved by the democratic
      Membership body of Melanin.

3. Melanin is structured around three distinct classes of Membership. The first
   two classes are collectively referred to as the "Operational Espians".

      principles articulated in § 2.

   2. *Open Espians.* Individuals who are engaged on a full-time or near
      full-time basis.

      the efforts by Operational Espians and thus.
